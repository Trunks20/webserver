# HTTP Web Server
This project is an exercise proposed by the Network Department of the FIC (Faculty of Computer Science of the UDC, A Coru√±a) and consists of creating an HTTP/1.0 web server. This server supports the GET and HEAD methods, .txt, .png, .jpg, .html files (among others similar) and some basic HTTP errors. A configuration file is provided to specify some basic properties as: port to listen, resources directory or default file. Two log files are provided too, where successful or failure responses from the server are recorded.

The server has been only tested in Linux Mint 19.2. If any problem happens, try to run with sudo.

## Configurating the server
The configuration of the server is done by a file called 'config.properties' inside the root folder. The configuration file has the next fields:
- PORT: port where the server listens.
- DIRECTORY_INDEX: name of the default file.
- DIRECTORY: relative path to the resources folder.
- ALLOW: when a folder is requested, the default file will be sent if exists. Otherwise, the directory content will be listed if allow is true and an 403 error (forbidden) will be prompt if allow is false.
- LOG_INDEX: relative path to the log files that record the requests.

**As DIRECTORY_INDEX as LOG_INDEX are relative paths from the configuration file 'config.properties'.**

## Running the server
Only the path to the configuration file is requested to execute the server. By default is at the root of the project, so an example of the path would be: /home/user/webserver/

**The path should end with '/'.**
